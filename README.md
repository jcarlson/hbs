Handlebars Dojo
===

Challenge 1: Implement `renderUsers` in application.coffee and replace the static HTML with a Handlebars template

Challenge 2: Create a Handlebars helper to render email links more succinctly

Challenge 3: Make sure the email helper you wrote can accept CSS class names as a parameter!

Challenge 4: Render your Handlebars template immediately on DOM-ready and implement a zero state for the empty set of users
You must then re-render the template when the JSON data [finally] returns from the server.

Challenge 5: Find another way to implement the logic in the "Presenting?" column?
For example, if you used a helper, you must now implement this logic without a Handlebars helper.
